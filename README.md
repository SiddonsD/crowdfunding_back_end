# Crowdfunding Back End
Denise Siddons

## Planning:

### AccessAid
AccessAid is a platform dedicated to improving accessibility for people with disabilities.

Accessibility accommodations can be costly making self-funding prohibitive for many individuals. Additionally, opportunities for funding supports through Government programs such as NIDS or through private sector initiatives are limited and/or subject to lengthy approval processes.

AccessAid was born to empower differently abled individuals by enabling timely access to funding for accommodations and supports of their choice, bridging the gap between need and mainstream support options. We believe everyone with a disability should be able to live the life they want with the accommodation supports they choose.

Crowdfunding through AccessAid may include funds for assistive equipment, prosthetic devices, accessible technology, environmental modifications or education and awareness campaigns.

### Intended Audience/User Stories
AccessAid is for differently abled individuals who need accessibility support, people caring for individuals who need supports, and community groups who support differently abled individuals.
